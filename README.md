# mcsc

A tool that makes creating Minecraft servers much easier and faster.

### Supported Server Types

Currently, only Paper servers are supported, but Spigot and Vanilla support are planned.Â 

### How does this work?

It's pretty simple: the website fetches every available server version from the Paper API, then after you press the download button, MCSC downloads the jar file of the version you have selected and bundles every file (server.jar, eula.txt, server.properties, README.txt, start.bat, and start.sh) into a zip file and then you download it.
